Functional Specific Document
Project Title: Interactive Cat Gallery
Overview:
The web application will consist of a simple, responsive, and user-interactive webpage. The application will fetch random cat images from TheCatAPI and display them to the user. The displayed cat image changes to a "meowing" cat image when clicked by the user. A speech bubble will appear, saying "meow" each time the cat image is clicked.

Design and Aesthetic:
The webpage will incorporate pastel colors and rounded elements, adhering to a cheerful and playful theme. On mobile view, the layout will adjust to offer a pleasant viewing and interaction experience across multiple devices.

User Interaction:
Users can interact with the application by clicking on the cat image.
When the cat image is clicked, it will change to a picture of a cat appearing to meow.
A speech bubble will display the text 'meow' whenever the cat image is clicked.
The meowing cat image will remain on screen for 5 seconds before it reverts to another normal cat image.
Technologies:
HTML for the structure of the web page.
CSS for styling and creating a responsive design.
JavaScript for managing user interactions and API calls to TheCatAPI.
TheCatAPI for fetching random cat images.
Browser Compatibility:
The application will be compatible with Google Chrome and Firefox.

Hosting:
The application will be hosted on GitHub pages.

Timeline:
This project is to be completed within a time frame of 2 hours.

User Story:
A user visits the webpage and is presented with a random cat image fetched from TheCatAPI.
The user can click on the cat image to interact with it.
Upon clicking, the image changes to a "meowing" cat and a speech bubble appears displaying 'meow'.
After 5 seconds, the "meowing" cat image is replaced by another random cat image, and the process can be repeated.
